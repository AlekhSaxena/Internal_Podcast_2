Coartem Tablets (artemether and lumefantrine) is an antimalarial drug, initially approved in the U.S. in 2009. It contains a fixed combination of 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine per tablet. Both components function as blood schizontocides and are active against the erythrocytic stages of *P. falciparum*.



### Indications and Limitations
*   **Approved Indication:** Treatment of **acute, uncomplicated malaria infections** caused by ***Plasmodium falciparum*** (*P. falciparum*).
*   **Target Population:** Patients **2 months of age and older** with a **bodyweight of 5 kg (11 pounds) and above**.
*   **Effectiveness:** Shown to be effective in geographical regions where **resistance to chloroquine has been reported**.
*   **Not Approved For:** **Severe or complicated** *P. falciparum* malaria.
*   **Not Approved For:** The **prevention of malaria**.
*   ***P. vivax* Infection:** Only treats the erythrocytic stage; **additional treatment with other antimalarial agents** is required to achieve radical cure (eradication of dormant liver hypnozoites).
*   **Pediatric Limitation:** Safety and effectiveness have **not been established** in pediatric patients younger than 2 months old or weighing less than 5 kg.

### Dosage and Administration
*   **Regimen:** A **3-day treatment schedule** totaling **6 doses** is recommended. Doses are given at 0 hours (initial), 8 hours later (second dose), and then twice-daily (morning and evening) for the following two days.
*   **Food Requirement:** Coartem Tablets **must be taken with food** to enhance the absorption of artemether (2- to 3-fold increase) and lumefantrine (16-fold increase). Failure to consume adequate food may increase the risk of recrudescence.
*   **Crushing Tablets:** For patients unable to swallow (like infants and children), tablets may be **crushed and mixed with 1 to 2 teaspoons of water** immediately before use, followed by food/drink if possible.
*   **Vomiting:** If vomiting occurs within **1 to 2 hours** after administration, a repeat dose should be taken. If the repeat dose is vomited, an alternative antimalarial drug should be prescribed.
*   **Grapefruit Juice:** **Do not drink grapefruit juice** while taking Coartem, as it can increase drug concentrations and potentially lead to QT prolongation.
*   **Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic or renal impairment, but caution is advised in patients with severe impairment.

### Contraindications
Coartem Tablets are contraindicated in patients meeting the following criteria:
*   Known **hypersensitivity** to artemether, lumefantrine, or any of the excipients.
*   Coadministration with **strong inducers of CYP3A4**, which can significantly decrease drug concentrations and cause loss of antimalarial efficacy. These include **rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort**.

### Warnings and Precautions (Cardiac Risks and Drug Interactions)
*   **QT Prolongation:** Coartem has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG).
    *   **Avoid use** in patients with known or congenital prolongation of the QT interval (long QT syndrome), severe cardiac disease, or disturbances of electrolyte balance (e.g., **hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia**).
    *   **Avoid other QT prolonging drugs**, such as Class IA or III antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone), antidepressants, and certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole/triazole antifungals).
*   **Use with Other Antimalarials:**
    *   **Halofantrine and Coartem Tablets should not be administered within one month of each other** due to potential additive effects on the QT interval.
    *   Quinine and quinidine should be used **cautiously following Coartem Tablets** due to the long half-life of lumefantrine and the potential for additive QT effects. ECG monitoring is advised if medically required.
*   **Hormonal Contraceptives:** Coartem **may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives** (e.g., birth control pills). Patients should be advised to use an **alternative non-hormonal method or add a barrier method** of contraception during treatment.
*   **CYP2D6 Substrates:** Lumefantrine inhibits CYP2D6 *in vitro*. Coadministration with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (especially those with cardiac effects, like flecainide or certain tricyclic antidepressants) may increase the risk of adverse effects and additive QT prolongation.

### Most Common Adverse Reactions
Adverse reactions were generally mild and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment in most cases.
*   **Adults (greater than 30%):** Headache (56%), anorexia (40%), dizziness (39%), asthenia (weakness/lack of energy) (38%), arthralgia (joint pain) (34%), and myalgia (muscle pain) (32%).
*   **Children (greater than 12%):** Pyrexia (fever) (29%), cough (23%), vomiting (18%), anorexia (13%), and headache (13%).
