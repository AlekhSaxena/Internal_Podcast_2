### Rhapsido (Remibrutinib) for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)

*   Rhapsido (remibrutinib) is the **first and only oral, targeted Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (BTKi)** approved by the U.S. FDA for adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).
*   **Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)** is a serious skin condition characterized by unpredictable flares of red, swollen, and itchy hives lasting six weeks or longer, often without a known cause.
*   An estimated **1.7 million people** in the United States live with CSU, and over half continue to have symptoms even after increasing doses of antihistamines.
*   Rhapsido is a **twice-daily oral tablet** that works by targeting the BTK protein to help inhibit the release of **histamine and other inflammatory mediators** that trigger CSU symptoms.
*   Clinical data showed that patients experienced **well-controlled disease as early as two weeks**.
*   The FDA approval is based on results from two Phase III trials (REMIX-1 and REMIX-2) which demonstrated **significant improvements in itch and hive scores** compared with placebo.
*   By Week 12 in the trials, approximately **one-third of patients achieved complete absence of symptoms**.
*   The treatment offers an **easy, oral option** that expands beyond injectable treatments and can fit seamlessly into daily life, giving patients control and confidence.
*   The safety profile is favorable, requiring **no lab monitoring**.
*   The most common side effects observed were mild, such as headache, sore throat, or nasal congestion.
*   Remibrutinib is also currently being studied for other immune conditions, including **food allergy, chronic inducible urticaria, and hidradenitis suppurativa**.
