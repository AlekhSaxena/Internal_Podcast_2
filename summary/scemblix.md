*   SCEMBLIX is also approved for Ph+ CML in CP in patients with the **T315I mutation**.
*   The approval of SCEMBLIX for newly diagnosed patients is based on a study that measured the **major molecular response (MMR) rate**. Ongoing studies are continuing to confirm its clinical benefit and long-term effects for this use.
